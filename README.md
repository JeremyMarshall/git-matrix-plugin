selenium-axis-plugin

This plugin creates an axis based on the Selenium grid capabilities.

You can then develop one job and run it against any or all of the Selenium capabilities it finds

It does this by creating three environment variables to pass to the build phase

TODO

It is not happy if you don't select a configuration. 

Probably should use an Any-Any-Any configuration

Create a second axis to use whatever Selenium capabilities are available when a build starts

Convert the config.jelly to config.groovy

Write some tests

Submit it to Jenkins
